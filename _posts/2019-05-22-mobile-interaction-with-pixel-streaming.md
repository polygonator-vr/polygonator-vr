Mobile interaction with Pixel Streaming.

Introduced in Unreal Engine 4.21, Pixel Streaming enables you to stream workstation-quality content to almost any web browser on any platform, without the viewer having to download or install anything—they simply access a link as they would to view a YouTube video. But unlike watching a video, the viewer can interact with that content, and even send responses back to the engine.&nbsp;

<br>It’s so much easier and faster than video.the viewer can interact with that content, and even send responses back to the engine.&nbsp;<br>You can access your project without a computer, simply from any iPad and smartphone.
