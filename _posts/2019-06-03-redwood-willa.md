RedWood Willa

Work on each scene begins with an idea that was born in the head or with a reference picture. We recently created a piece of California. In this project we created a secluded villa on a lake. It is interesting that the main hero of this project was not the villa itself, but a magnificent forest and lake.

We want to show you the progress we have achieved so far. The main details of this project is a large part of the exterior.

Here are the images of the perspective of the main camera, as well as the secondary image that I took, and I'm still not sure what I like more at the moment.
